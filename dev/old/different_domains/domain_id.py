This script writes the geo file. This script works with multiple domains and the surface id for that domain
is same as the id for the shape file in the shapefile. This script also respects the physical line id which 
is defined using define_id script.

This script has an option to allow the user to choose if BSpline or Line has to be used. Anotehr option is
to enable compound lines.
