\section{Introduction}
<Image 1>

Rasterise Polygons produces a NetCDF file(s) from Shapefile polygons with the same dimensions as the specified background layer. This differs from the existing Rasterize tool in QGIS under Raster -> Conversions -> Rasterize which only creates a file as large as the polygon's bounding box. Rasterise Polygons will also import the newly created NetCDF files into QGIS in Pseudolcolour rather than the default Grayscale. \\

\section{Tutorial}
The example shown here has a bathymetry NetCDF file loaded as the background layer and two polygons on seperate layers. Their ID's are displayed for reference and can be turned on by right-clicking a the polygon layer -> Properties -> Labels, tick 'Display labels' and set the 'Field containing ID' dropdown to id and click 'OK'.

\section{Usage}
The polygons used to create the raster layers must have an integer ID which is set when the polygon is created. The example
